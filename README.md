### Config Options

- In the `ahk/` directory, set up any number of AutoHotKey scripts:
  - `hotstrings.ahk` for generalized shortcuts
  - `secrets.ahk` for non-public shortcuts not to be committed
  - etc.
- In the `bin/` directory, configure scripts that use dynamic data and need to invoke other functions outside of the main function
- In the `config/` directory, configure a Bash profile based on various settings:
  - `.bashrc` holds a full config file that is symlinked to `~`
  - `.gitconfig` holds git config info that is symlinked to `~`
  - `.inputrc` for Bash prompt customizations
  - `.ruff.toml` holds Python linting rules symlinked to `~` for global use
  - `.secrets` holds data not for committing to git
- In the `./nvim` directory, configure a Neovim profile.
- In the `./.vscode` directory:
  - `settings.json` for VS Code user settings
  - `extensions.txt` for essential VS Code extensions
- In the `./wsl/` directory, configure WSL-only settings and functions

### Bash Customizations

- Use Ctrl+J/Ctrl+K to scroll up and down through command history
- Use escape to clear current prompt entry

### Handling Secrets

Assuming you are properly authorized to do so on the machine in question:

```bash
make insert-secrets
```

Push `./config/.secrets` and `./ahk/secrets.ahk` into the encrypted `password-store`.

Or push individually:

- `make insert-ahk`
- `make insert-bash`

```bash
make pull-secrets
```

Pull data from the `password-store` into locations at `./config/.secrets` and `./ahk/secrets.ahk`

Or pull individually:

- `make pull-ahk`
- `make pull-bash`

```bash
make sync-secrets
```

Attempt to sync data between `password-store` and local secrets files. Because this may
have unintended consequences, local secrets files are backed up first (`password-store`
would require a commit to truly overwrite).

## Initial Windows Setup Notes

For when you're truly starting from scratch.
